### General Guidelines

**Important:** I'm no longer able to maintain this project, as I do not have an active account to test with. That said, GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. If there is enough peer-review and community support, pull requests may be merged in.

If you're interested in contributing, please branch off of and target pull requests for the **`dev`** branch.

It can be difficult to accurately test for edge cases for users who have already been approved for Global Entry, since it's not possible to schedule an interview if you're already approved. Because of this, please only submit a pull request if you have thoroughly tested your fork.

Once contributed code has been tested on `dev` by the community, it will be merged into `master`.

### Ideas & Feature Requests

If you'd like to help out but aren't sure where to start, here are a few feature ideas that are welcome:

* Ignored dates: allow the user to provide a list of days for the checker to ignore
* Plugin system: update `ge-checker-cron.py` to allow configuration for running multiple phantom scripts and keeping track of multiple appointment systems (not just a Global Entry cheker - e.g., the DMV).

If you have an idea for another great feature or improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
